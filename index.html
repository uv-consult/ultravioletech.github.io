                <h2>Consulting Services</h2>
                <h4><b>Blockchain Feasibility </b> <br> Initial Project Evaluation</h4>

                <p>Blockchain is still a young technology with many implementations which did not provide expected value
                    due to lack of strategic approach and evaluation. For that reason, our consulting services start
                    with an assessment to determine if there are a potential value and feasibility that justifies an
                    investment in blockchain solution. In this process detail understanding of the projects is acquired
                    as the ground for the selection of blockchain technologies, architecture and frameworks that are
                    most adequate to create estimated value and your business requirements.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h4><b>Blockchain Architecture</b> <br>Public and Private Blockchain</h4>
                <p>Once blockchain is evaluated as a feasible technology for particular use-case, design of Blockchain
                    architecture is the key for successful integration of the solution. Depending on business
                    requirements, blockchain network can be open and public or private and only accessible to people who
                    are given permission to use it. Blockchain architecture includes designing private and public
                    networks, as well as transactions logic including smart contracts that's used to calculate fee for
                    participants.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h4><b>Confidential Computing Design and Implementation</b> <br>Privacy-Preserving Computation</h4>
                <p>Preserving user's privacy is one of the main challenges of modern cloud-based computing.
                    Ultraviolet Consult provides consulting services from design, conceptual solution, over PoC
                    development to the final product. Confidential computing faces problems of storing, moving, and
                    processing data in a secure way. Protecting data usually comes at the cost of performance and
                    designing solutions requires a deep analysis of the particular use-case to evaluate security risks.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h4><b>End-To-End Data Protection</b> <br>End-To-End privacy, integrity and authenticity of your data
                </h4>
                <p>When talking about end-to-end data protection, it's usually implied that it's about protecting data
                    in transit. Ultraviolet Consult team provide consulting services around the state of the art
                    technologies for protecting data in motion. Alongside with protecting data in motion, we are also
                    working on the development of the cutting edge methods for protecting data in use, allowing user to
                    manipulate data securely and execute computation on data without need to ever encrypt it.

                    science in the 21st century so far. It is a form of encryption allowing computation on encrypted
                    data without ever decrypting it. The result
                    of these computations is also encrypted. Expansion of cloud computing exposed sensitive data to new
